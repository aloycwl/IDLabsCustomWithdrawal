# IDLabsCustomWithdrawal

ID Labs is a scam and sham money game devise. Their founder Howard Wu have been involved with many scams and he can't go back to China.

Long story short, their contract is written via ERC-1967 proxy which means they can change whatever code they want and it is fully centralised.

The proxied code wasn't submitted or verified so you cannot call to their contract directly.

We have explored their website and using decoded their javascript to retrieve the withdrawal function.

In case their website is down, you can excute the claim function manaually with the example I have uploaded in this repo.
